(a)Deploy the aforementioned forms using NodeJS server in AWS EC2 Windows instance. 
These forms use the POST method to communicate details with the server.

(b) Validate the correctness of the fields defined in store.js and update.js using the Node.js server program 
deployed with AWS Lambda functions. On successful validation send a congratulation message along the same form 
as a dynamic HTML response. On Failed form validation send appropriate error message along same form as a dynamic 
HTML response.



(c) Upon successful validation of the forms, utilize GCP's Cloud SQL to store the provided details in the MySQL database.
 (The Lambda functions defined in part (b) perform the required operations.)
